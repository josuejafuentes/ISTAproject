society has advanced a lot over the years, so much so to the point that convenience has reached many aspects of our lives from the cars that we drive, the food that we eat and the places we go to acquire new stuff such as clothes or gadgets to further improve our lifestyles, we have definitely reached a point in our lives where all this is almost essential to live and we have come a long way from where we first started. but with all of these improvements in our lives we have taken a lot of our focus onto improving our health in as many ways as we can whether be through multivitamins or daily check-ups from the doctor nevertheless people are now more than ever on top of their health and will do anything to better improve upon it, a lot of people like to keep healthy by keeping track of what they eat and how much they exercise sometimes this can be hard especially when we have a busy schedule and don't have much time to measure foods or make calculations so there's many applications in order to help make the load easier on us.

I  plan on designing and creating an app that can help customers track their calorie intake and macro-nutrients as well as counting their steps and record each time is done in order to create a profile that is suited for the specific customer needs. It will be able to create a workout plan and nutritional guide list based on body type, activity and chosen diet, as well as, suggestions of meals to help to the specific goal whether it be losing, gaining or maintaining weight, it will also take into account an individual specific preference for workout from calisthenics, weightlifting and cardiovascular activities. The data needed to accomplish the task would be first a name in order to identify a user from a multitude of people, second, a password in order to gain access to the customer individual diet and workout routine. In order to build that workout routine the input of weight, height and age will be needed in order to calculate the daily calorie intake needed in order to either lose, gain or maintain weight
once that information is provided the customer has to choose what he intends to do this will prompt the user to enter a diet plan of their choice or pick one from a list displayed to them, once that information is gathered the customer can choose what workout routine they prefer; calisthenics, weightlifting or cardiovascular exercise, each one will give the customer a choice: to pick their own workout or let the computer find the best suited workout with the prior information.

Although the app can be very resourceful it won't attract many customers if it doesn't have a good user's interface, I want to create a user's interface that will allow easy access to the app and smooth input of data the create profile tab will have the username bar display as well as the password bar display, it will take up the whole screen and in case the user forgets the password the moment he clicks in the password bar display it will display an option to retrieve the password based on the username, once the user logs in he will be showed his plan displayed as tabs one to show his diet another one to show his workout routine and another one to show his current caloric count once he clicks one each different options will be displayed in each respective tab for example his diet tab will display the macros he has consumed based on the food he has logged into the app and how many he has left as well as a list of meals that he could prepare in order to complete his caloric intake for the day and places where he can buy the products. I plan to make the app as easy to understand as possible.

though I have yet to figure out a way to implement my code into the app the display can be easily created  there is many programs that you can use in order to do so figma is one of them and it seems to be quite popular so I think I will go with that.

In conclusion this app will be able to make the life of possible customers a lot easier and healthier and could potentially use improvement in order to better the app and make it easier to navigate this will be used as a template in order to further develop the app and look back on in order to hash out possible miscommunication with a team
