# complexity of websites
###### Josue Fuentes​
​
Throughout mankind's history humans have always have the tendency of somehow​
build and improve on their lifestyles by means of discoveries and inventions,​
the discovery of fire was most likely one of the first and most useful disco-​
-very humans ever made, that led to even more discoveries and inventions, such as​
tools, farming and eventually the adaptation from small gatherings to whole​
societies. Is needless to say that multiple brains can think better than one,​
slowly humans were able to come up with sophisticated ways to improve on their​
way of life, advancements in technology allowed us to achieve greatness in​
all aspects of life, one of these aspects that has now taken off in a major way​
is the building of machines that can work without the aid of human interaction​
and in many ways improve upon tasks that were previously thought of as complex​
and time consuming. the advancement of these technologies can be seen in various​
aspects of life from the machines that can replace people in a factories to the​
browsers we use at home to gather information or simply use for entertainment​
the complexity of said browsers are often overlooked by most people simply for​
the fact that the knowledge is not needed to perform the task that we intent to​
do however it is still interesting to learn about what makes these websites fun-​
-ction.​
​
### Google​
Google is the most popular web browser used by people to browse the net​
one question that can easily escape one's thought is: "how does this browser gather​
the data needed to run properly" and the answer is rather easy to answer Google​
is after all the most popular and used web browser in the world this popularity​
has made google widely successful as well as wealthy by 2018 the company was estimated​
to be worth 110.8 billion dollars with this hug success and wealth google has managed​
to acquire multiple companies as well as develop multiple software and technologies​
such as the google Pixar phone and A.I. that can facilitate the gather of information​
google collects data throughout searches being made by it's users as well as the​
websites that get selected in searches however google doesn't stop there in order​
to better help it's users google collects preferences made by users in various​
websites as well as keywords and adds clicked by users, two of Google's biggest source​
of information come from the android IOS (that google has access to) as well as​
Gmail although an argument can be easily made about how all this information is a​
violation of privacy and the dangers that it poses to it's users is also worth to​
mention that without the gathering of this data development of technology could be​
set back and the usefulness of the browser wouldn't be as great Google is popular​
and wealthy for a reason and the pros heavily out weights the cons one of google's​
biggest aspect is how different and special it's user interface is compared to other​
browsers for example google has a trademark algorithm named "PageRank" which grabs the​
most popular websites and puts them as the first displays in a search allowing easier​
access to information for it's users. Google also collects and query's keywords​
in order to further develop itself and the results it provides for users which brings​
me to the next topic the processing logic behind the web browser. Google will use​
the data gathered by its user's and use it to make decisions based on preference​
and give results that best fit the user's search for example if a user was to search​
for "cats" it would gather data from previous search uses keywords find popular​
choices and look for the users previous searches and preferences and give a desirable​
outcome.​
​
### Twitter​
Twitter is a popular social media website mostly targeted to a younger​
demographic that being said is popularity has risen more and more throughout the​
years allowing the company to gather data for different uses from advertising to​
personal data in order to find a user's profile twitter relies heavily on the data​
that is willingly provided by it's users and will use the information to help with​
results on any search by using keywords just like Google does for example if a user​
searches for "doctor" on the search engine it will display only information provided​
by it's users as well as the privacy settings the user has that will allow for the​
information to be displayed however this information can be easily accessed with​
the right permissions given by the company and could potentially become a risky​
website to use overall social medias can be risky to use but they do provide with​
multiple ways to connect to services or people in a simple and quick manner. Twitter​
user's interface is rather simple yet innovative using Ruby on Rails for its frontend​
code the app makes a point of making the experience as simple as possible by having​
four different tabs present at the bottom of the screen one displaying feed from​
other users one for notification from interaction with other users another one​
for private messages and one last one for access to personal information in order​
to change personal private preferences, search preferences or display preference​
such as background color or profile pictures and such. the app also displays their​
logo on their home page that allows you to know where you are at all times as well​
as a search button on the upper right corner of the app to allow you to search for​
people as well as groups or even keywords twitter has named "tags". twitter's processing​
logic much like Google's allow users to find results based on personal information​
and public data by different user's as well as tags used in pictures or keywords​
on a user's profile.​
​
### GrubHub​
Grubhub is different from Google and Twitter it is a popular food delivery app that​
started back in 2004 and slowly gained popularity and became what is known today​
grubhub gathers different data from different resources in order to improve the utility​
and reach of the app first it gathers data from it's users such as email, address,​
payment information and preferences then it gathers data from the area where the​
customer resides to include restaurants in the area popularity of restaurants other​
user's reviews prices menus and even different styles of food such as Hispanic​
Asian or any other available food all this information becomes important in the final​
product GrubHub provides which is ultimately a fast and fresh delivery from local​
restaurants Grubhub user's interface is fast and easy allowing ordering to be fast​
it starts off with asking a user's address following with a display of restaurants​
in the area that deliver with grubhub as well as business hours and different types​
of foods in the area ranked by popularity once a restaurant is chosen the respective​
restaurant's menu will display allowing user interaction in order to place an order​
once the choices have been made a user can proceed by using a personal account which​
limit the utility of the app but provides future reference for faster orders and adjusted​
preferences.​
​
In conclusion the advancements of technology in our society has put us in a path​
of a better living standard in multiple aspects of life from communication and interaction​
with each other as well as the convenience of having food delivered to the comfort of home​
understanding the way different technologies work can allow us to further develop our​
way of life as well as discovering new ways to improve on existing technologies and become​
a smarter and better informed society.​
